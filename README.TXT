PROJECT TITLE: Exam 1 - Fixed Solutions
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To learn from my mistakes and develop a better understanding of the material
VERSION or DATE: Version 1 - Feburary 28 2025
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open it through the program "BlueJay"
AUTHORS: Floyd Xing
USER INSTRUCTIONS: No instructions

Today's opportunity to look back on these questions and correct them was very helpful in helping
me understand the material better such as ArrayLists and loop statements while also helping me to
look out for certain things while writing code on paper or even in a programin the future.
Overall, I think this should be repeated for the next exam.
